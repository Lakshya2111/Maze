# Maze
A maze generator and solver using BFS and DFS with images.
* For generating a maze run: 
   * python generate.py maze.txt(filename to save the maze)
* To solve a maze run:
   * python (speccify the file).py maze.txt(to load the maze)
* Image file will be saved to maze.png
* You can check the visited states by changing the show_visited to "True" in the source code of the algorithms
